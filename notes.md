- name: Daniel Meyer
- department: SPMGPP
- type: research
- Please provide a detailed description of the current business process that you believe could benefit from automation: -> The automation of the capturing of research outputs, using google scholar citations to identify authors with all relevant info. The current process is ad hoc and uncoordinated, causing conflict.
- To help us better understand, please provide a concise name or title for the process or system in question: -> Research output capturing process.
- Could you identify the main obstacle or difficulty in this process from your perspective: -> More than 90 papers need to be identified and captured from 20 researchers across the globe. Papers are missed and the process to capture is problematic.
- Are there any other suggestions on how CBE can improve its business processes and operational efficiency: -> Most processes are manual, the red tape take away most of the time of researchers. A 1IR environment.
- 
### ideas
- research admins...?
- Use the Google Scholar API or web scraping techniques to retrieve citation.
- extract important information. store only imoprtant information.
- automate the extraction process.
- review data regularly.
- apply data validation to check if the data is real or not.
- find research admin problems.
- find way to automate approval procedures and diplomatic steps.
- Explore technology solutions that can automate and streamline various aspects of research administration. This could include project management tools, collaboration platforms, electronic document management systems, or research-specific software applications. Adopting such tools can help optimize workflows, improve efficiency, and reduce manual paperwork.



## FR two.
- name: Hossana Twinomurinzi
- department: SCIIS-AIS
- type: research
- Please provide a detailed description of the current business process that you believe could benefit from automation: -> We desire a database where all academics are registered with their research topics of interest. By searching for a topic of interest, for example, energy, it will bring up all the academics working in that area. I can then send off an email to those academics at once.
- To help us better understand, please provide a concise name or title for the process or system in question: -> Researcher topic database.
- Could you identify the main obstacle or difficulty in this process from your perspective: -> Right now we depend on Heads of Departments to disseminate this information which might result in overload.
- Are there any other suggestions on how CBE can improve its business processes and operational efficiency: -> By making this efficient enough to inform the HOD if the researcher is doing more in funding compared with their teaching workload.
- 
### ideas:
- user provide link or pdf. if link craw the url and save information to database.
- i need data to monitor a researchers activities between research-funding and teaching. These metrics could include the number and value of research grants obtained, the time spent on grant applications, the number of teaching hours, student feedback on teaching, or any other relevant data points.
- provide real-time monitoring of the researcher's activities.
- set metric used to find where researcher spend most of their time.
- make a feedback system where the hod are informed of the pattern found.
- been able to cluster the research using unsupervised machine learning.
